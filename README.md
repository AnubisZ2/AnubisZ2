- 👋 Hi, I’m @AnubisZ2 and I’ve had this account for too long to not post anything for anyone to 
read or know about me. The world is changing faster than I had hoped and I rather go with the 
change than be surprised by what will happen next. Thank you GitHub encouraging me to write this!

Now honestly, I’ve avoided learning tech for fear of looking dumb and feeling like I’m out of 
place. I also fear being outdoors more than indoors but many tech companies seem to enjoy the same.

- 👀 I’m interested in politics, environmental issues, natural resources, and technical writing. 
Also!! A huge reason for why I am interested in technology is to enhance my ability to write 
technical documentations for security companies.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning alot of different subjects because I believe in learning for 
life but some of the important subjects now are: python, SQL, network security, analytics, 
japanese, french, spanish, philosophy ... 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything dealing with environmental resources, 
migration patterns, mineral resources, energy comparisons, and everything dealing 
with human nature (very open to interpretation because people are complex enough)
- 📫 How to reach me ... lets talk on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenneth-bethea-435519199/
